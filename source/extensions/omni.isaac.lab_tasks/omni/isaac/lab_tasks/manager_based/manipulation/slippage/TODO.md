- [x] add no velocity obs group
- [ ] domain randomization in policy observation group
- [ ] rewards vs obs: ee_frame vs robot.data vs object pos in robot root frame
- [ ] implement inter finger distance
- [ ] termination:object dropping : test two options
- [ ] check damping and stiffness values (as these are randomized, range should make sense)
- [ ] check if reset terms are order conservative (guess so)
- [ ] "end-effector sensor" ? (just to have a reference for marker or mdp)
